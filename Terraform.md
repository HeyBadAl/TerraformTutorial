Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and manage infrastructure in a declarative way, using a high-level configuration language. With Terraform, you can automate the creation, modification, and deletion of infrastructure resources such as virtual machines, networks, storage, and more across various cloud providers, as well as on-premises data centers.

Terraform follows a modular approach, where infrastructure resources are defined as reusable modules, which can be shared and versioned independently. This makes it easier to manage and scale complex infrastructures. Terraform also provides a state management system that tracks the current state of the infrastructure, which allows it to perform intelligent updates and avoid conflicts between different configurations.

Terraform supports many cloud providers, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and many others, as well as a number of other infrastructure providers. It is a popular tool among DevOps engineers, system administrators, and cloud architects for its ability to automate infrastructure provisioning and management.
